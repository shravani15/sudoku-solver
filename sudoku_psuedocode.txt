Problem:
We have 15 puzzles given. 
We need to create a fully functional sudoku solver that runs from command line
THe solver will solve the puzzle.
We also need to verify the puzzle solved is correct solution or not

Doing it for a 3x3 sudoku


Pseudocode for solver:
We have ONE mainGid and NINE subGrids. We have rows and columns

1. Select a number between 1-9 to place in the mainGrid, for example: '1'
2. Decide where to place it ? (position). It needs to be placed in a subGrid which does not have the selected number [i,e 2-9]. 
    How?
        - Check all rows OR all columns in the mainGrid to see which rows don't have selected number '1'. Mark those rows and select a subGrid.

        - If there are multiple subGrids which have vacancies for '1' then select an vacant cell in a subGrid which doesn't contain '1' by 
          checking the follwing conditions
            
            - If '1' is NOT possible in more than 1 rows AND OR 1 colummns of the mainGrid AND if there are multiple such subGrids 
                    {
                        then select one of the subGrids at random and fill the vacancy with '1' 
                        OR fill all of them at ONCE and move to the next number i,e '2'.
                    } 
            - Else if '1' is possible in more than 1 rows AND OR 1 columns of the subGrid (i,e if there are more than one vacancies for '1' in a subGrid))
                AND if there are multiple such subgrids 
                    {
                        then move onto the next number i.e '2' and repeat the process from step 2.  

                    }
            - Else if '1' is NOT possible in more than 1 rows AND OR 1 columns of the mainGrid AND if there is ONLY ONE such subGrid 
                    {
                        then select that subGrid and fill the vacancy with '1' and 
                        then move on the next subGrid to fill the remaining vacancies in other subGrids with '1'

                        if not then move on to the next number i.e '2' and repeat from step 2
                    }
3.  In the mean time, simultaneously check rows and columns of the mainGid

            - if there is only ONE number (between 1-9) to be filled in a vacancy of a row or column of the mainGid
                    {
                        then fill in the vacancy with that number.
                    }
            - And if there is only ONE number (between 1-9) to be filled in a vacancy of a row or column of the subGrid
                    {
                        then fill in the vacancy with that number.
                    }
4.  If the number '9' is reached in this process then check whether all the numbers have been filled and that 
                        there are no numbers which are repeating in any row or column of the mainGrid

                        if up to '9' doesn't fill up the vacancies then go back to step #1 and repeat till all cell vacancies are full.

                        if all cells are full then return (puzzle solved)



            
Reasoning: Check the rows and columns of the maingrid that are also part of the subgrid to see if there is '1' anywhere 
                if there is '1' anywhere then move on to check other cells in the rows and columns of the maingrid that are also part
                else if there are no '1' in more than one cell in the subgrid then go to that subgrid where '1' is possible in only 
                    one of the cells the and then repeat process of placing another '1'
                else it means that there is just one cell in the subgrid where '1' can be placed. So, place and move on.

                if there are still subgrids with '1' left where there is chance of more than one unassigned cell to take the value of '1'
                then move on the the next number i.e 2, so that you can come back to filling '1's later.

                if there is a choice of selecting from two subgrids then stop the algorithm and move on to next number '2' and come back to it later.

                if there is a choice of selecting from more than one subgrid AND more than one rows and colummns then try to select the subgrid with more
                numbers filled in. If not move on to another number and come back 
                to it later


        - Eliminate the rows and columns of the subgrid and which are also part of the maingrid which have '1'

        - Assign '1' to one of the remaining cells.

Check the mainGrid everytime to see whether there are any rows, columns and subgrids which don't have a'1'
Repeat placing '1' using above methods by checking the remaining rows, columns and subgrids until all the rows.
